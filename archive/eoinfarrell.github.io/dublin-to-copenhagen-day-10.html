<div class="goals">
<h4>Goals for the day</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Contact camp site in Caleis to book and get closing time of check in</li>
    <li>Make it to Dover in time for half 5 boat so I'm not to late getting to camp site in Caleis</li>
    <li>Leave early enough that I can make the half 4 boat</li>
</ul>

<div class="notableMoments">
<h4>Noteable Moments</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Run down to co-op and buy bread, ham and cheese for sandwiches for the next few days</li>
    <li>Leave an hour late, 2 days after I was originally planning on leaving Brighton, there goes any hope of the half 4 boat</li>
    <li>Get phone call from Amy straight after leaving saying I forgot stuff</li>
    <li>Decide to cycle directly across cliffs rather than follow road after Seaford</li>
    <li>Manage to get over first set of cliffs, then have to cross a beach and return to road as next set of cliffs are way to steep for the bike, and I wasn't pushing it up them</li>
    <li>Stop to try jellied eals in hastings, not bad, wouldn't be going for them again</li>
    <li>Stop in Rye for a quick coffee and sandwich, realise I wasted way to much time on cliffs earlier and will need to sprint the last 60km or so to Dover</li>
    <li>Manage 30km an hour average for just under 2 hours to make it to Dover in time</li>
    <li>Just enough time to spare for a quick stop in Greggs and buy another 3 meals deals for myself, no soup so get an extra susage roll thrown in for free</li>
    <li>Make it onto boat and devour food</li>
    <li>Personallised escourt out of Caleis harbour as only normal exit leads straight to moterway</li>
    <li>Quick spin into Caleis town to take a look and hit an ATM</li>
    <li>Constant patrols by French police around the harbour, in vans with 5 or 6 in each. Spot one or two small groups of hopeful migrations along the way</li>
    <li>Proceed on 20km cycle to camp for the night</li>
</ul>
