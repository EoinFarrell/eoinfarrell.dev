<h4>Noteable Moments</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Stuffed myself with buffet brekfast</li>
    <li>Booked a campsite half way between Bristol and Bath for the night over brekfast</li>
    <li>Got annoyed at Komoot Bike Ride routing bringing me through parks for 100 meters with barries so switched to Road Bike routing</li>
    <li>7 sisters bridge crossing one of the highlights of the trip</li>
    <li>25c and sunny :D</li>
    <li>Drop and smash the glass on my phone while trying to cycle and navigate after taking a wrong turn on a greenway</li>
    <li>Great greenway between Bristol and Bath along old railline</li>
    <li>Reach campsite about half 4, basic facilities, but it was only Â£9</li>
    <li>Realise its a lot easier to setup a tent, in the light, on flat ground, and when you aren't knackered</li>
    <li>Head to pub down the road for a pie and mash dinner with a pint of bitter</li>
</ul>
