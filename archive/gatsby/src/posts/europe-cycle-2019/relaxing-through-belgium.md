*   Don't start the final, beaten by Stuey
*   Subbed on with about 20 minutes to go at 0-0
*   Match finishes 0-0, where we win on penalties
*   Head to pub down the road for celebratory drinks and don't leave till midnight
*   Make it back home about 2 hours before I have to wake up so decide probably best I don't sleep
*   Proceed to fall asleep on coach as soon as I sit down, no alarm set
