# Dublin to Copenhagen - Day 10

### Brighton to Caleis

[Previous](dublin-to-copenhagen-day-9.html)



#### Goals for the day

*   Contact camp site in Caleis to book and get closing time of check in
*   Make it to Dover in time for half 5 boat so I'm not to late getting to camp site in Caleis
*   Leave early enough that I can make the half 4 boat



#### Noteable Moments

*   Run down to co-op and buy bread, ham and cheese for sandwiches for the next few days
*   Leave an hour late, 2 days after I was originally planning on leaving Brighton, there goes any hope of the half 4 boat
*   Get phone call from Amy straight after leaving saying I forgot stuff
*   Decide to cycle directly across cliffs rather than follow road after Seaford
*   Manage to get over first set of cliffs, then have to cross a beach and return to road as next set of cliffs are way to steep for the bike, and I wasn't pushing it up them
*   Stop to try jellied eals in hastings, not bad, wouldn't be going for them again
*   Stop in Rye for a quick coffee and sandwich, realise I wasted way to much time on cliffs earlier and will need to sprint the last 60km or so to Dover
*   Manage 30km an hour average for just under 2 hours to make it to Dover in time
*   Just enough time to spare for a quick stop in Greggs and buy another 3 meals deals for myself, no soup so get an extra susage roll thrown in for free
*   Make it onto boat and devour food
*   Personallised escourt out of Caleis harbour as only normal exit leads straight to moterway
*   Quick spin into Caleis town to take a look and hit an ATM
*   Constant patrols by French police around the harbour, in vans with 5 or 6 in each. Spot one or two small groups of hopeful migrations along the way
*   Proceed on 20km cycle to camp for the night
