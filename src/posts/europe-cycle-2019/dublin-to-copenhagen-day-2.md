# Dublin to Copenhagen - Day 2

### Fishguard to Cardiff

#### Goals for the day

*   Continue off-roading across Welsh Mountains and head towards Carmarthen
*   Continue onwards to Newport, figuring out accomodation along the way



#### Noteable Moments

*   Dense fog upon waking up
*   Broke front pannier bag while off roading
*   Hills get worse if anything after returning to road.
*   So many sheep in wales
*   Make it to Carmarthen and proceed to ordeer 3 Greggs meal deals
*   Realise I've had enough mountains and decide to move South and follow coast to Newport
*   Some great greenways on the way down to Llanelli
*   Stop for late lunch half way between Port Talbot and Cardiff, realise its getting late and conceede defeat and book hotel for Cardiff rather than Port Talbot
*   Greenways continue most of the way to Cardiff, to bad for awful entry gateposts and slow reacations from Komoot
*   Reach hotel at a reasonable 8pm and proceed to ordre awful overpriced take away
*   Look over cycle and realise I cycled further with more hills by diverting south to coast rather than continuing across moutains on pre-planned route, and I'm in Cardiff rather than Newport
*   Fall asleep fully clothed without managing to get under covers
