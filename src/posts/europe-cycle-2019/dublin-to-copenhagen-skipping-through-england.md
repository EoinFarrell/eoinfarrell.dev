# Dublin to Copenhagen - Day 3

### Cardiff to Bristol

#### Goals for the day

*   Make it to Bristol
*   Figure out where to stay in Bristol

#### Noteable Moments

*   Stuffed myself with buffet brekfast
*   Booked a campsite half way between Bristol and Bath for the night over brekfast
*   Got annoyed at Komoot Bike Ride routing bringing me through parks for 100 meters with barries so switched to Road Bike routing
*   7 sisters bridge crossing one of the highlights of the trip
*   25c and sunny :D
*   Drop and smash the glass on my phone while trying to cycle and navigate after taking a wrong turn on a greenway
*   Great greenway between Bristol and Bath along old railline
*   Reach campsite about half 4, basic facilities, but it was only Â£9
*   Realise its a lot easier to setup a tent, in the light, on flat ground, and when you aren't knackered
*   Head to pub down the road for a pie and mash dinner with a pint of bitter
