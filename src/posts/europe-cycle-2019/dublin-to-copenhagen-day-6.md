# Dublin to Copenhagen - Day 6

### Dublin to Brighton

#### Goals for the day

*   Make flight from Dublin to Bristol
*   Get train from Bristol to Southampton
*   Book car rental for Thorpe Park trip tomorrow
*   Cycle from Southampton to Brigthon and stay with Amy for 2 days



#### Noteable Moments

*   Wake up on coach 10 minutes late for my bus
*   Rush to get ready, end up not packing half the things I wrote down to get in Dublin
*   Make the next aircoach, quite busy and figure its taking to long, so hop off after 5 minutes to get taxi
*   Get to the airport 35 minutes before my flight departs
*   Manage to get through security quickly and make it to gate just in time
*   Sleep for the whole flight
*   Arrive in Bristol and collect bike from storage and proceed to catch train to Southampton
*   8 bikes on a 3 carriage train makes for a cosy fit
*   Arrive in Southampton and head off for Brighton
*   Stop in Littlehampton to grab lunch in Lidl and sit beside the harbour
*   Decide to sprint to Brighton, see how fast I can do it, only to be halted in Goring-By-Sea due to a front puncture
*   15km to Brighton, requires taking the front rack and mud guards partly off (and I still don't have a pump). Decide I'll run instead
*   Cover 5km before Charles from South Africa flags me down and offers me a lift in his van with his wife. Thank you Charles for going out of your way to give me a lift all the way
*   Arrive in Brighton and head to the apartment and order Thai for dinner with Amy and Anna
*   Head to the train station that night to meet Conor when he arrives
