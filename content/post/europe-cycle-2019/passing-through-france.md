#### Noteable Moments

*   Followed greenway to Bath, quite busy with morning commuters

*   Tour lasts about 2 hours and finshes back up by the Roman baths
*   Spot the GCN team
*   With 3 hours before I have to leave, I go to the new baths/spa. Pretty pricy for 2 hours, but hopefully it will help with my muscles before my football match tomorrow
*   Two swimming pools, one indoors and one on the rooftop terrace. Very warm and relaxing
*   6 steam rooms and saunans, some of them very weird...
